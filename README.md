# UHmeditates

5/1/2021
The Project now has CocoaPods (framework that keeps dependencies up to date) and this will require us to open the UHMeditates.xcworkspace file instead of the .xcodeproject file to make our changes. If you open the .xcodeproject file, you'll notice you get errors about missing frameworks so that'll be the queue to switch over to the right file before starting to code. The same process for GitHub applies within it.
